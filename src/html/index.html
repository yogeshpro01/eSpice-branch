				What is Brainfuck 	?

			<div class="abtext">
				Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and notable for its extreme minimalism. Müller designed Brainfuck with the goal of implementing it with the smallest possible compiler inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the FALSE programming language. Müller's original compiler was implemented in machine language and compiled to a binary with a size of 296 bytes.<br><br>

				The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

				The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.

				<br><br>

				The language consists of eight commands. A brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands, possibly interspersed with other characters. The commands are executed sequentially, with some exceptions: an instruction pointer begins at the first command, and each command it points to is executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command. <br> <br>
